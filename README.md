# MapOps — Versioned Package
This ZIP contains your uploaded homepage (as index.html) and the new Why MapOps page.

## Files
- `index.html` — from your uploaded `index_TAGLINE_NEXT_TO_WHY.html` (unchanged layout).

## Deploy
1) Create a new repo (e.g., MapOps_vNext).
2) Upload both files at the root.
3) Enable GitHub Pages → Deploy from branch.
4) Open: https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/
